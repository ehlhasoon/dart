//When you run the code above, the print statement on line 4 will execute first 
//and then the second print statement on line 5 will execute.
//
//This style of programming is called imperative programming. 
//It's a programming paradigm wherein you write a set of instructions that execute in sequential order.
//Imperative programming doesnâ€™t necessarily describe what the program should accomplish, 
//rather it shows how the program should accomplish it.

// import 'dart:io';
// //dart:io library provides I/O (Input/Output) support for non-web applications.
// //We imported dart:io because the program we wrote requires input from the user.
// void main() {
//   print('Please enter your name:');
  
//   //stdin stands for standard input
//   //readLineSync() method (function) which reads a line from the input.
//   var name = stdin.readLineSync();

//   print('Hello $name');
