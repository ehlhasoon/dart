//3. DATA TYPES

//The Dart language has special support for the following types:
//
//Numbers
//Strings
//Booleans
//Lists
//Sets
//Maps
//Runes
//Symbols

//Data Types divided in 2 categories:
//1. Reference type (Reference to some object, i.e memory address of where an object is stored)
//2. Value type (Value itself)

//All data types are objects in Dart
// v/s primitive data types are value types in most languages

//DEFAULT VALUE
//uninitialized variables have initial value of null
//null means that the variable is not referencing an object, it's not referencing anything

//LITERALS
//defined as anything in its most usual and basic sense
//literals are fixed values appearing directly as they do in source code
//e.g "Hello World", 5, 'A'
